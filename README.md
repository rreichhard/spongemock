# Spongemock String Converter

This was a small project that came up organically at work. In a groupchat with co-workers we would often manually type text in "spongemock" as a reference to the [meme.](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/mocking-spongebob)

![Alt text](https://github.com/rreichhard/spongemock/blob/main/mockingspongebobbb.jpg)

For those who may not be familiar, this meme is used to *"indicate a mocking tone towards an opinion or point of view"*

## Benefit

What makes this Spongemock script different is that it will create a .txt file for you with the converted string. I have found that copy/pasting the cell outputs into messaging programs is shifty and ugly. I spend more time "fixing" the formatting after pasting than I would have just manually typing the message. This way a small .txt file is created which makes it super easy to copy/paste.
